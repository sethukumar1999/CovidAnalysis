   INTRODUCTION

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the source of the extremely contagious viral disease known as COVID-19. The virus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and it has since spread quickly throughout the world, sparking a global pandemic. When a person with COVID-19 talks, coughs, or sneezes, respiratory droplets are the main way in which it is transmitted. Additionally, contaminated surfaces and items can spread the infection.
